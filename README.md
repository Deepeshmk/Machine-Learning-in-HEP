# Machine-Learning-in-HEP

This is the assignment for the course Machine Learning and Physics Applications taught by Prof Sourabh Dube at IISER Pune in March 2023. There are two data files with simulated noisy data of the WZ and ZZ processes at CERN. The task is to create a neural network model which can distinguish between the two processes with a high success rate.
